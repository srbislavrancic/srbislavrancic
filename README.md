Ellow there ðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m Srbislav

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in 2D and 3D related things like [Autoit, C++, Python with 'Irrlicht Engine'], [Android Studio, with 'LibGDX'], [core Java with Spigot] and [core HTML, PHP, JS, CSS with 'WebGL']
I consider my self as a software developer that can provide good solutions over web interface or as an app on windows/linux/android os.

While not limited to above mentioned programing languages, i do limit my self by not using frameworks that drastically change the way you code in preferred language.
